# Configuration

This theme currently supports four theme variants: One Dark, One Dark italic, One Dark vivid, and One Dark vivid italic.  All four variants are built from the same source files and will thus have the same colors and effects with the only difference being the italic variant italicizes certain language constructs such as keywords, comments, annotations, etc and the vivid variant slightly changes the intensity of the colors.

If you have interest in additional theme variants, please open a feature request so the variant idea can be discussed and possibly implemented. If you are interested in developing a new theme variant, please open an issue first so the idea can be discussed by the maintainers of this repository.
