# Configuration

This theme currently supports two theme variants: One Dark and One Dark italic. Both variants are built from the same source files and will thus have the same colors and effects with the only difference being the italic variant italicizes certain language constructs such as keywords, comments, annotations, etc.

If you have interest in additional theme variants, such as a [vivid variant](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-vivid-syntax), please open a feature request so the variant idea can be discussed and possibly implemented. If you are interested in developing a new theme variant, please open an issue first so the idea can be discussed by the maintainers of this repository.
